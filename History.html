<pre>
<p style="font-size:14px;">The first version of HTML(HTML1.0) was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. It provided basic structural elements and allowed for the inclusion of hyperlinks.<br>Alongside HTML he also developed the first web browser the WorldWideWeb. Since then there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely<br> used version is throughout the 2000's was HTML4.01 which became an official standard in December 1999.
<p style="font-size:14px;">HTML2.0 was released in 1995 which expanded the range of supported elements and introcducing tables for tabular data.HTML3.2 was released in 1997, it<br>brought further enhancements to tables, inroduced forms of user input and provided support for basic stylesheets. HTML4.01 was released in 1999, introduced<br>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) for improved control over page styling and it was the most widely used version.
<p style="font-size:14px;">In 2000,XHTML(eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) was introduced which aimed to combine HTML with the stricter rules and extensibility of XML.<br>Hundreds of XML languages are in use today such as GML(Geography Markup Language), MathMl, MusicMl and RSS(Really Simple Syndication). Since each of <br>these languages was written in a common language (XML) their content can easily be shared across other applications. 
<p style="font-size:14px;">However in recent years, the W3C in collaboration with another organisation, the WHATWG has been working on a brand new version of HTML(HTML5). HTML5<br>was released in 2014, it introduced a wide range of new elements and atrributes and provided better compatibility with obile devices. HTML5 is still a draft<br>specification and not yet an official standard.
